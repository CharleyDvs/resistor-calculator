<a alt="Nx logo" href="https://nx.dev" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nrwl/nx/master/images/nx-logo.png" width="45"></a>

This project runs a resistor calculator UI and API, the user choose the colors and the band and it will display the resistance equivalence

## Install the application

This app was created as a MonoRepo with Nx using Vite and Yarn, to install the project just clone the repo

```sh
git clone git@github.com:CharleyDvs/resistor-calculator.git
```

and install with Yarn:

```sh
yarn install
```

## Start the application

To start the application just use:

```sh
yarn start
```

this will run both the UI and API in parallel.

## Storybook

Components for this project are fully documented and tested, once the installation is finished just use:

```sh
yarn storybook
```

## Testing

To run unit tests, use the command:

```sh
yarn test:unit
```

For e2e testing:

```sh
yarn test:e2e
```

✨ **This workspace has been generated by [Nx, Smart Monorepos · Fast CI.](https://nx.dev)** ✨ So all comands available in Nx also work for the application, read below:

## Integrate with editors

Enhance your Nx experience by installing [Nx Console](https://nx.dev/nx-console) for your favorite editor. Nx Console
provides an interactive UI to view your projects, run tasks, generate code, and more! Available for VSCode, IntelliJ and
comes with a LSP for Vim users.

## Build for production

Run `npx nx build Resistor-Calculator` to build the application. The build artifacts are stored in the output directory (e.g. `dist/` or `build/`), ready to be deployed.

## Running tasks

To execute tasks with Nx use the following syntax:

```
npx nx <target> <project> <...options>
```

You can also run multiple targets:

```
npx nx run-many -t <target1> <target2>
```

..or add `-p` to filter specific projects

```
npx nx run-many -t <target1> <target2> -p <proj1> <proj2>
```

Targets can be defined in the `package.json` or `projects.json`. Learn more [in the docs](https://nx.dev/features/run-tasks).

## Set up CI!

Nx comes with local caching already built-in (check your `nx.json`). On CI you might want to go a step further.

- [Set up remote caching](https://nx.dev/features/share-your-cache)
- [Set up task distribution across multiple machines](https://nx.dev/nx-cloud/features/distribute-task-execution)
- [Learn more how to setup CI](https://nx.dev/recipes/ci)

## Explore the project graph

Run `npx nx graph` to show the graph of the workspace.
It will show tasks that you can run with Nx.
