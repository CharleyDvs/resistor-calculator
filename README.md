# ResistorCalculator

<a alt="Nx logo" href="https://nx.dev" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nrwl/nx/master/images/nx-logo.png" width="45"></a>

This project runs a resistor calculator UI and API, the user choose the colors and the band and it will display the resistance equivalence

## Install the application

This app was created as a MonoRepo with Nx using Vite and Yarn, to install the project just clone the repo

```sh
git clone git@github.com:CharleyDvs/resistor-calculator.git
```

and in the app folder install with Yarn:

```sh
yarn install
```

## Start the application

To start the application just use:

```sh
yarn start
```

this will run both the UI and API in parallel.

## Storybook

Components for this project are fully documented and tested, once the installation is finished just use:

```sh
yarn storybook
```

## Testing

To run unit tests, use the command:

```sh
yarn test:unit
```

For e2e testing (Not fully finished):

```sh
yarn test:e2e
```

## Design tokens

Design tokens are variables used in as scss variables that control most of the appeareance of the app and it's components. 
This app has it's own design tokens as part of its design system, these tokens come from JSON files that could be generated by an app like Figma, for the moment it only has colors. You can find this values in the folder `/libs/shared/styles/tokens`.

### Modifying design tokens

*Note: Generate design tokens is completely optional as the app already has a set of design tokens*

Just overwrite the json files with whatever values you want, this tokens are generated using amazon's Style dictionary, for more info about the structure you can read more [here](https://amzn.github.io/style-dictionary/#/). After installing it's recommended to install Style dictionary globally:

```sh
npm install -g style-dictionary
```

installing it as a dev-depency could require config changes, after the library is installed just run:

```sh
yarn generate:tokens
```

this will create a new _tokens.module.scss_ at the root of the styles library that you can import from your components. It is not recommended to add values manually as the file will be overwritten with the command, however manual changes can be made in the JSON files.

## Future developments for the project

- Connect to a real database
- Add tests to the backend
- Document the backend with swagger
- Generate types from the backend
- Add Cypress tests for the frontend
- Adopt more design tokens
- Setup a CI/CD pipeline
- Dockerize 

✨ **This workspace has been generated by [Nx, Smart Monorepos · Fast CI.](https://nx.dev)** ✨ So all comands available in Nx also work for the application, read below:

## Integrate with editors

Enhance your Nx experience by installing [Nx Console](https://nx.dev/nx-console) for your favorite editor. Nx Console
provides an interactive UI to view your projects, run tasks, generate code, and more! Available for VSCode, IntelliJ and
comes with a LSP for Vim users.

## Build for production

Run `npx nx build Resistor-Calculator` to build the application. The build artifacts are stored in the output directory (e.g. `dist/` or `build/`), ready to be deployed.

## Running tasks

To execute tasks with Nx use the following syntax:

```
npx nx <target> <project> <...options>
```

You can also run multiple targets:

```
npx nx run-many -t <target1> <target2>
```

..or add `-p` to filter specific projects

```
npx nx run-many -t <target1> <target2> -p <proj1> <proj2>
```

Targets can be defined in the `package.json` or `projects.json`. Learn more [in the docs](https://nx.dev/features/run-tasks).

## Set up CI!

Nx comes with local caching already built-in (check your `nx.json`). On CI you might want to go a step further.

- [Set up remote caching](https://nx.dev/features/share-your-cache)
- [Set up task distribution across multiple machines](https://nx.dev/nx-cloud/features/distribute-task-execution)
- [Learn more how to setup CI](https://nx.dev/recipes/ci)

## Explore the project graph

Run `npx nx graph` to show the graph of the workspace.
It will show tasks that you can run with Nx.
